I think to fix our problem we are going to redo our app plan and switch to a space 
defenders style app that will use SpriteKit and we will have a game playing view, a 
leaderboard view which will be a table and a start view for when the game is started 
and ended. We will also have a notification set up for the user to ask them if they 
want to play every once in a while.
