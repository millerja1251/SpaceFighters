1. Following the MVC Design Pattern

0.4*1 + 0.4*0.95 + 0.2*1 = 0.98

Everything looked for the design and everything followed MVC but in each of the documents you need to have your names and emails with your team name and the date of the submission

2. Correctly Incorporating all required user interface elements

0.4*1 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*1 = 1

Everything was laid out well and there aren't any missing things that would be there

3. Make substantial use of the required listed frameworks

0.4*1 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*1 = 1

Everything here looks good you guys have all the requirements met for the frameworks.

Overall 99.2%
