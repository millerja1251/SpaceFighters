1. Following the MVC Design Pattern

0.4*1 + 0.4*0.95 + 0.2*1 = 0.98

Everything looked for the design and everything followed MVC but in each of the documents you need to have your name
and corresponding IU emails which would most likely lose you some points. I would suggest that instead of having the 
README with all of your names you have it at the top of all of your documents.

2. Correctly Incorporating all required user interface elements

0.4*1 + 0.4*0.8 + 0.2*1 = 0.92

Everything was laid out but we did not see anywhere what type of container view controller you guys were going to use
and if there would be one at all so just make sure you guys have that since it is one of the requirements.

3. Make substantial use of the required listed frameworks

0.4*1 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*1 = 1

Everything here looks good you guys have all the requirements met for the frameworks.

Overall 96.8%
