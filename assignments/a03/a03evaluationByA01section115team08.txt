I. Documentation

1. Following the MVC Design Pattern

0.4*1 + 0.4*0.95 + 0.2*1 = 0.98

Everything looked for the design and everything followed MVC but in each of the documents you need to have your names and emails with your team name and the date of the submission

2. Correctly Incorporating all required user interface elements

0.4*1 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*1 = 1

Everything looked good and all of them where seen in the documents

3. Make substantial use of the required listed frameworks

0.4*1 + 0.4*1 + 0.2*1 = 1

They had all of the required amounts of frameworks shown in the documentation

Overall 99.2%

II. 

1. Program Completeness

97%

The app did not crash and there did not seem to be any problems running the code. The way the code was 
implemented also worked every time that I ran the code such as the fact that the ball was able to 
bounce the whole time and nothing went wrong in that aspect. I only will say I think that the table 
view should have been visible and connected to one of the other views.

2. Specifications

100%

Everything that was required was there. All the views were in the main with a coresopiong view 
controller. There was also implementation of more than two of the frameworks. Which was what was 
needed for the assignment.

98.5%
